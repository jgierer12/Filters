## speechBubbles Filter
#### by jgierer12, idea by SimplySarc

*This is a Filter for [MCEdit](http://www.mcedit.net)*

This Filter generates "speech bubbles" above Entities as seen in [this](http://youtu.be/2jYX526zgII) video.

### Library
#### Characters
Included characters:
- Letters
  * A-Z
  * a-z

  * 0-9
- Punctuation
  * `.`
  * `,`
  * `:`
  * `!`
  * `?`
  * `_`
  * `Ћ` *This character will curretly not work because MCEdit replaces some characters with `?`s in Filter inputs!*

If a character is unknown, it will be replaced with a `_`.

If you want me to include a character that is not yet included, refer to the [contribute section](#contribute).

#### Emoticons
**An emoticon will only be applied if there is no character directly before or after it!**

Included emoticons:
- `:)`

- `:|`
- `:D`

If you want me to include an emoticon that is not yet included, refer to the [contribute section](#contribute).
