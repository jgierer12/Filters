# TextToBook Filter
#### by jgierer12, suggested by MasterM64

*This is a Filter for MCEdit (http://www.mcedit.net)*

This Filter converts *.docx and *.txt files to Minecraft books.

### Compatibility
#### Resource Packs
The filter currently only supports Resource Packs that use the default minecraft font. If you want me to include another Resource Pack you can [create an issue](https://github.com/jgierer12/MCEdit-Filters/issues/new) or [send me an E-Mail](mailto:j.gierer12@gmail.com) (Please make sure you include a download link to the Resource Pack ;) ).
#### Special characters
If there are problems with center/right alignment of text or if there are too many letters on one page you can also [create an issue](https://github.com/jgierer12/MCEdit-Filters/issues/new) or [send me an E-Mail](mailto:j.gierer12@gmail.com). If possible, include a screenshot of the page and a copy of the text or document you used!
